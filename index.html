                 <h3>1816-1833:Niépce's earliest fixed images</h3>
                 
                 <p>In 1816, Nicéphore Niépce, using paper coated with silver chloride, 
                 succeeded in photographing the images formed in a small camera, but the 
                 photographs were negatives, darkest where the camera image was lightest and 
                 vice versa,and they were not permanent in the sense of being reasonably light-fast;
                  like earlier experimenters,d t Niépce could find no way to prevent the coating from 
                  darkening all over when it was exposed to light for viewing. Disenchanted with silver salts,
                   he turned his attention to light-sensitive organic substances.</p>
             </div>
             <br>
             <div>
                 <h3>1832 to 1840: early monochrome processes</h3>
                 <p> Niépce died suddenly in 1833, leaving his notes to Daguerre. 
                     More interested in silver-based processes than Niépce had been, 
                     Daguerre experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like 
                     silver-surfaced plate that had been fumed with iodine vapor, which reacted with the 
                     silver to form a coating of silver iodide. As with the bitumen process, the result appeared 
                     as a positive when it was suitably lit and viewed. Exposure times were still impractically 
                     long until Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that an invisibly slight or "latent" image 
                     produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be "developed" to full visibility 
                     by mercury fumes. This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum
                     conditions. A strong hot solution of common salt served to stabilize or fix the image by 
                     removing the remaining silver iodide. On 7 January 1839, this first complete practical photographic 
                     process was announced at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, and the news quickly spread. 
                      At first, all details of the process were withheld and specimens were shown only at Daguerre's studio, 
                      under his close supervision, to Academy members and other distinguished guests.Arrangements were made 
                      for the French government to buy the rights in exchange for pensions for Niépce's son and Daguerre and present 
                      the invention to the world (with the exception of Great Britain, where an agent for Daguerre patented it) as a free gift. 
                      Complete instructions were made public on 19 August 1839. Known as the daguerreotype process, it was the most common 
                      commercial process until the late 1850s when it was superseded by the collodion process.</p>

             <div>
                 <h3>1850 - 1900 Collodion process</h3>
                 <p>In 1851, English sculptor Frederick Scott Archer invented the collodion process.
                     Photographer and children's author Lewis Carroll used this process. 
                     (Carroll refers to the process as "Talbotype" in the story "A Photographer's Day Out".)
                    Herbert Bowyer Berkeley experimented with his own version of collodion emulsions after 
                    Samman introduced the idea of adding dithionite to the pyrogallol developer.[citation needed]
                     Berkeley discovered that with his own addition of sulfite, to absorb the sulfur dioxide 
                     given off by the chemical dithionite in the developer, dithionite was not required in the 
                     developing process. In 1881, he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, 
                     sulfite, and citric acid. Ammonia was added just before use to make the formula alkaline. 
                     The new formula was sold by the Platinotype Company in London as Sulphur-Pyrogallol Developer.
                    Nineteenth-century experimentation with photographic processes frequently became proprietary. 
                    The German-born, New Orleans photographer Theodore Lilienthal successfully sought 
                    legal redress in an 1881 infringement case involving his "Lambert Process" in the 
                    Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>

                 <h3>Development of Digital Photography</h3>
                 <p>In 1957, a team led by Russell A. Kirsch at the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
                    developed a binary digital version of an existing technology, the wirephoto drum scanner, 
                    so that alphanumeric characters, diagrams, photographs and other graphics could be transferred
                    into digital computer memory. One of the first photographs scanned was a picture of Kirsch's 
                    infant son Walden. The resolution was 176x176 pixels with only one bit per pixel, i.e., 
                    stark black and white with no intermediate gray tones, but by combining multiple scans of the
                    photograph done with different black-white threshold settings, grayscale information could also be acquired.
                    The charge-coupled device (CCD) is the image-capturing optoelectronic component in first-generation digital 
                    cameras. It was invented in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith at AT&T Bell Labs as a memory device. 
                    The lab was working on the Picturephone and on the development of semiconductor bubble memory. Merging these 
                    two initiatives, Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed "Charge 'Bubble' Devices". 
                    The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor. 
                    It was Dr. Michael Tompsett from Bell Labs however, who discovered that the CCD could be used as an imaging sensor. 
                    The CCD has increasingly been replaced by the active pixel sensor (APS), commonly used in cell phone cameras. 
                    These mobile phone cameras are used by billions of people worldwide, dramatically increasing photographic 
                    activity and material and also fueling citizen journalism.  
                    1973 – Fairchild Semiconductor releases the first large image-capturing CCD chip: 100 rows and 100 columns.
                    1975 – Bryce Bayer of Kodak develops the Bayer filter mosaic pattern for CCD color image sensors
                    1986 – Kodak scientists develop the world's first megapixel sensor.</p>
